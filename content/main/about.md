### Me

Hey, I'm **Pakreht**, can call me **Pak** (ಠ‿<)

Currently **Houdini Technical Artist** in the Video Game Industry, mainly working on environment tools & pipelines.

Coming from a Computer Science background i am well-versed  with math, programming and other technical stuff, a bit less used to the pure art side which is why I've decided to train myself to become a polyvalent environment technical artist. My goal is to gain a lot of artistic skill and combine them with what I've already have to be able to make large, optimized and good looking environment, packed into nice semi procedural, user controlled pipeline.

This blog is the place where i will share this learning process, and hopefully create a small community around that •ᴗ•

### The Blog

I am the kind of person which need to understand something fully before making any use of it, i hate working blind and need to control the tools i am interacting with. This can sometime be a handicap when in need to work fast, but for long term works, it is a blessing.

That tendency mixed with my apprehension of forgetting have lead me to take extensive notes about everything. This, again make the work a bit slower but the learning gained through the synthesis process is vastly superior. And countless times, I've had to redo something very specific, but thanks to my notes, I didn't have to redo the research, it was all waiting for me.

> What a selfish person would i be to keep all this knowledge for myself, have i thought 

Thus **Pakreht.com** was born •ᴗ•

### An indie game ?

I would love to make an **Indie Game** at some point, something.. personal. Its been on my mind for quite some time now, and i hope that i will be able to achieve this at some points.

The experience I am acquiring will be valuable in that future, and the community i am starting to build might even be a lever that helps me achieve this goal.

I can't say much right now because it is too early, but a **Devlog** category might pop one day !
